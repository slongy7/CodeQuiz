## Online Coding Quiz

This project had me create an online quiz based on coding.  This appears to be a very important skill to have when you go into coding, as it teaches you how to create something using mostly Javascript.  It's very hard to do for me at this point, as I will point out in my "Bugs" section.  I had to use a lot of research, video watching and Inspections on multiple sites to get it to where it is.

### Bugs
I had issues having the leaderboard display after each round.  I believe I maybe needed to create an additional HTML, but I wasn't confident in that.  I also had my multiple choice selections stlyed, but then the style dissapeared on me, so I'll be studying up on that as well.

I also have some errors in my JavaScript that I had to comment out, and will work on fixing those until the time this assignment is due.

### Learnig Experience
I will continue to study up on Javascript as we move forward.

Credits: I had a lot of help from some members of my class for this project.
